        /* Question 01:
Your client said that he needs a dropdown, which contains all days of the running month. Sometimes we fill up a registration form that, which date of birth. So find out in google (get number of days in specific month php) and do this assignment using a for loop.
Day quantity is not equal for every month. Like as - february - 28, March - 31, april - 30
So days of running month should dynamic (by php build in function) */

    $running_month = date("t");

    // for ($running_month = 1; $running_month <31 ; $running_month++) { 
    //     echo $running_month;
    //     echo "<br>";
    // }

    
echo    $running_month;
